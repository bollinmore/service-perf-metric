## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Monitor service latency (Priority: P1)

A feature engineer monitors latency trends for their owned service to detect regressions before they impact users.

**Why this priority**: Directly empowers engineers responsible for service health to act quickly on latency incidents.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by validating the engineer can view latency metrics for a single service without additional setup.

**Baseline Reference**: Existing P95 latency for the service as recorded in the current monitoring system over the past 7 days.

**Evidence Deliverables**: Dashboard screenshot showing P95 latency trends, test plan confirming access controls, alert configuration summary referencing P95 thresholds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** they open the dashboard for their service, **Then** they see P95 latency charts scoped to that service for the last 7 days.
2. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** P95 latency exceeds the configured threshold, **Then** the dashboard highlights the breach within one page view.

---

### User Story 2 - Tune latency thresholds (Priority: P2)

A feature engineer adjusts the P95 latency threshold for a specific service and immediately sees projected alert behavior changes.

**Why this priority**: Threshold tuning reduces alert fatigue and ensures paging happens only when meaningful regressions occur.

**Independent Test**: Engineer updates a threshold via dashboard controls or API and observes new value reflected within the alert configuration preview without impacting other services.

**Baseline Reference**: Current threshold value from `observability/config/alert-rules.yaml` and 7-day baseline P95 for the selected service.

**Evidence Deliverables**: Threshold change audit log entry, updated configuration screenshot, alert simulation report demonstrating new behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** they adjust the P95 threshold for their service, **Then** the system validates the range (50–1000 ms) and saves the override with an audit note.
2. **Given** a saved threshold override, **When** the engineer previews the alert simulation, **Then** the dashboard displays projected breach intervals using the new threshold within one refresh.

---

### User Story 3 - Export latency data (Priority: P3)

A feature engineer exports latency metrics for their service to share with analysts or run offline investigations.

**Why this priority**: Data export supports deeper analysis without granting full dashboard access and enables long-term archival for compliance.

**Independent Test**: Engineer requests an export for a service and receives a downloadable CSV or API response containing the requested window without timing out.

**Baseline Reference**: Generated dataset should match dashboard P95 latency for the selected window and include associated request counts.

**Evidence Deliverables**: Export job log entry, sample CSV/API payload attached to tasks.md, validation that export respects access controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** they request a CSV export for their service, **Then** the system queues the job and delivers a download link within 5 minutes.
2. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer with API access, **When** they call the export endpoint with a time window, **Then** the response returns P95 latency, request counts, and source log versions consistent with the dashboard data.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- Missing data window: When log ingestion gaps exist, dashboard panels and exports MUST render with explicit gaps and banner warning; do not substitute synthetic values.
- Access violation: If engineer requests data for services outside their ownership, system MUST deny with audit log entry.

## Metric Lineage & Evidence *(mandatory)*

### Authoritative Data Sources

- **Service Latency P95**: Parsed application access logs, owned by Observability Platform team, refreshed every 5 minutes via log pipeline.
- **Error Context Metrics**: Application log-derived error rates, owned by Observability Platform team, refreshed every 5 minutes via log pipeline.

### Transformation Controls

- Execution path: `make ingest-latency-metrics` → container image `obs/log-parser:latest`.
- Dependency lockfile: `log-parser.lock` maintained in observability repository.
- Data-quality gates: schema drift on log fields, freshness check ensuring updates within 10 minutes, null-value rejection for latency field.

### Baseline Measurements & Targets

- **Service Latency P95**: 7-day rolling window, current value auto-imported per service, target breach threshold configurable per team but default ≤ 350 ms.
- **Error Context Metrics**: 7-day rolling window, current P95 error latency, alert if variance increases >20% from baseline.

### Observability & Alerts

- Dashboards: Grafana dashboard `service-latency-dashboard` showing P95 latency, request volume, and related error metrics with freshness indicators.
- Alerts: P95 latency > threshold for 3 consecutive intervals triggers PagerDuty notification to owning feature team; runbook stored in `docs/runbooks/latency.md`.
- Evidence Storage: Attach validation artifacts (dashboard screenshots, alert test results) to `specs/001-arguments/tasks.md` once generated.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST render a per-service dashboard view showing 7-day P95 latency, request counts, and breach highlights for authenticated engineers.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow engineers to submit P95 threshold overrides per service/environment and validate values fall between 50 and 1000 ms before persisting.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to export latency data for owned services via CSV download or authenticated API call within configurable time windows.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an alert simulation preview that visualizes projected breach intervals using the pending threshold before engineers confirm changes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist an auditable log covering threshold updates and data exports, recording actor, timestamp, values changed, and justification notes.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of production services display 7-day P95 latency and request counts to their owning engineers within 5 seconds of dashboard load.
- **SC-002**: Median time for engineers to submit a threshold change and view the updated simulation preview is under 30 seconds.
- **SC-003**: 85% of surveyed feature engineers report improved confidence in latency monitoring and threshold management after adoption.
- **SC-004**: Reduce latency-related support tickets raised to observability/data teams by 40% within one quarter of launch.
