# Feature Specification: Service Latency Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-arguments`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Service latency dashboard"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What is the core feature we’re specifying (e.g., “Service latency dashboard”)? → A: Service latency dashboard
- Q: Who is the primary audience for this dashboard? → A: Feature engineers monitoring their own services
- Q: Which latency metric should the dashboard emphasize for alerting? → A: 95th percentile latency (P95)
- Q: Which existing data source should provide the latency metrics? → A: Parsed application logs
- Q: When the dashboard loads, what default time window should it display? → A: Last 7 days
- Q: User Story 2 is currently blank. Which outcome should it deliver? → A: Let engineers tune P95 thresholds and see impact

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Monitor service latency (Priority: P1)

A feature engineer monitors latency trends for their owned service to detect regressions before they impact users.

**Why this priority**: Directly empowers engineers responsible for service health to act quickly on latency incidents.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by validating the engineer can view latency metrics for a single service without additional setup.

**Baseline Reference**: Existing P95 latency for the service as recorded in the current monitoring system over the past 7 days.

**Evidence Deliverables**: Dashboard screenshot showing P95 latency trends, test plan confirming access controls, alert configuration summary referencing P95 thresholds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** they open the dashboard for their service, **Then** they see P95 latency charts scoped to that service for the last 7 days.
2. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** P95 latency exceeds the configured threshold, **Then** the dashboard highlights the breach within one page view.

---

### User Story 2 - Tune latency thresholds (Priority: P2)

A feature engineer adjusts the P95 latency threshold for a specific service and immediately sees projected alert behavior changes.

**Why this priority**: Threshold tuning reduces alert fatigue and ensures paging happens only when meaningful regressions occur.

**Independent Test**: Engineer updates a threshold via dashboard controls or API and observes new value reflected within the alert configuration preview without impacting other services.

**Baseline Reference**: Current threshold value from `observability/config/alert-rules.yaml` and 7-day baseline P95 for the selected service.

**Evidence Deliverables**: Threshold change audit log entry, updated configuration screenshot, alert simulation report demonstrating new behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated feature engineer, **When** they adjust the P95 threshold for their service, **Then** the system validates the range (50–1000 ms) and saves the override with an audit note.
2. **Given** a saved threshold override, **When** the engineer previews the alert simulation, **Then** the dashboard displays projected breach intervals using the new threshold within one refresh.

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Baseline Reference**: [Baseline metric window/value and link to evidence documenting current state]

**Evidence Deliverables**: [Tests, dashboards, alerts, or logs required to prove the story succeeded]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Metric Lineage & Evidence *(mandatory)*

### Authoritative Data Sources

- **Service Latency P95**: Parsed application access logs, owned by Observability Platform team, refreshed every 5 minutes via log pipeline.
- **Error Context Metrics**: Application log-derived error rates, owned by Observability Platform team, refreshed every 5 minutes via log pipeline.

### Transformation Controls

- Execution path: `make ingest-latency-metrics` → container image `obs/log-parser:latest`.
- Dependency lockfile: `log-parser.lock` maintained in observability repository.
- Data-quality gates: schema drift on log fields, freshness check ensuring updates within 10 minutes, null-value rejection for latency field.

### Baseline Measurements & Targets

- **Service Latency P95**: 7-day rolling window, current value auto-imported per service, target breach threshold configurable per team but default ≤ 350 ms.
- **Error Context Metrics**: 7-day rolling window, current P95 error latency, alert if variance increases >20% from baseline.

### Observability & Alerts

- Dashboards: Grafana dashboard `service-latency-dashboard` showing P95 latency, request volume, and related error metrics with freshness indicators.
- Alerts: P95 latency > threshold for 3 consecutive intervals triggers PagerDuty notification to owning feature team; runbook stored in `docs/runbooks/latency.md`.
- Evidence Storage: Attach validation artifacts (dashboard screenshots, alert test results) to `specs/001-arguments/tasks.md` once generated.
