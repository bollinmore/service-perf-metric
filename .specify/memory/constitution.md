# Service Performance Metric Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accountable Data Lineage
- Every metric MUST declare its upstream data sources, extraction schedule, and ownership in the relevant spec or plan before implementation begins.
- Data transformations MUST be defined as version-controlled, idempotent jobs with documented input/output schemas.
- CI/CD pipelines MUST execute automated data-quality checks (schema drift, freshness, null-rate) and block deploys on failure.
Rationale: Transparent lineage ensures stakeholders can trust comparisons and trace regressions quickly.

### Deterministic Metric Pipelines
- All computation steps MUST be reproducible via scripted execution (`make`, CLI, or container entrypoint) without manual intervention.
- Metric logic MUST include unit and property-based tests that pin expected calculations using fixture datasets.
- Runtime environments MUST be declared via lockfiles or container manifests to prevent configuration drift.
Rationale: Deterministic pipelines enable consistent metrics across environments and audits.

### End-to-End Observability
- Each service contributing metrics MUST emit structured logs with correlation identifiers for every ingest, transform, and publish step.
- Critical metric thresholds MUST be backed by automated alerts routed to the owning team with documented runbooks.
- Dashboards visualizing metric freshness, success rates, and alert status MUST be created or updated before release.
Rationale: Observability guarantees that metric regressions are detected and triaged before they impact consumers.

### Performance Baseline Enforcement
- Proposals MUST capture the current performance baseline, including sample windows and acceptance thresholds, before any optimization work starts.
- Implementations MUST record post-change measurements using the same methodology and attach evidence to the feature spec or tasks artifact.
- Deployments MUST include rollback criteria tied to metric regressions beyond agreed thresholds.
Rationale: Baseline-driven work keeps improvements honest and prevents unverified changes from reaching production.

### Incremental Delivery with Evidence
- Features MUST be sliced so each user story or task delivers a measurable, independently testable outcome.
- Tests validating the new capability or metric change MUST be authored and executed before merging implementation code.
- All changes MUST document their validation steps (tests run, dashboards screenshots, alert dry-runs) in the associated plan or tasks output.
Rationale: Incremental, evidence-backed delivery reduces risk and keeps the project continuously demonstrable.

## Operational Standards
- **Environment Reproducibility**: All workloads MUST run in container images or virtual environments pinned to exact dependency versions committed to the repo.
- **Security & Privacy**: Any metric containing user-identifiable data MUST apply data minimization, masking in logs, and documented retention limits.
- **Access Control**: Metric storage backends MUST implement role-based access; credentials MUST be stored in secret managers, never in source control.
- **Documentation**: Each metric family MUST maintain a living document detailing definition, calculation steps, owners, and alert thresholds.

## Delivery Workflow
1. **Discovery & Planning**: Capture problem statement, authoritative data sources, and baseline expectations in `plan.md`; run the Constitution Check before research starts.
2. **Design & Specification**: Produce `spec.md` with independent user stories, explicit validation plans, and baseline/bounds updates.
3. **Task Breakdown**: Generate `tasks.md` grouped by user story, including required validation, observability, and rollback tasks.
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks with tests-first sequencing, keeping evidence (test logs, dashboards, alert confirmations) attached to each story.
5. **Review & Compliance**: Code reviews MUST verify adherence to principles, confirm evidence is stored, and ensure baselines improved or maintained.

## Governance
- **Authority**: This constitution supersedes conflicting practices for the Service Performance Metric project.
- **Amendments**: Changes require a written proposal summarizing impact, approval from project maintainers, and updates to all referenced templates.
- **Versioning Policy**: Amendments follow semantic versioning—MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for new principles or standards, PATCH for clarifications.
- **Compliance Reviews**: Quarterly audits MUST verify that active features reference baseline evidence, test artefacts, and observability assets per this document.
- **Distribution**: Updated constitutions MUST be communicated to all contributors with a summary of principle changes and template adjustments.
